    "An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the biological nervous systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key element of this paradigm is the novel structure of the information processing system. It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements (neurones) working in unison to solve specific problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs, like people, learn by example. An ANN is configured for a specific application, such as pattern recognition or data classification, through a learning process. Learning in biological systems involves adjustments to the synaptic connections that exist between the neurones. This is true of ANNs as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first artificial neuron was produced in 1943 by the neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and the logician Walter Pits. But the technology available at that time did not allow them to do too much.\n"

    "1. Input Layer\n",
    "2. Hidden (computation) Layers\n",

    "__Input Nodes (input layer)__: No computation is done here within this layer, they just pass the information to the next layer (hidden layer most of the time). A block of nodes is also called layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hidden nodes (hidden layer)__: In Hidden layers is where intermediate processing or computation is done, they perform computations and then transfer the weights (signals or information) from the input layer to the following layer (another hidden layer or to the output layer). It is possible to have a neural network without a hidden layer and I’ll come later to explain this.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Output Nodes (output layer)__: Here we finally use an activation function that maps to the desired output format (e.g. softmax for classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Connections and weights__: The network consists of connections, each connection transferring the output of a neuron i to the input of a neuron j. In this sense i is the predecessor of j and j is the successor of i, Each connection is assigned a weight Wij.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Activation function__: the activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs. A standard computer chip circuit can be seen as a digital network of activation functions that can be “ON” (1) or “OFF” (0), depending on input. This is similar to the behavior of the linear perceptron in neural networks. However, it is the nonlinear activation function that allows such networks to compute nontrivial problems using only a small number of nodes. In artificial neural networks this function is also called the transfer function.\n",

    "For a neural network to work it is required to train it. training is when a neural network learns.\n",
    "\n",
    "when neural networks are trained they process records one at a time, and \"learn\" by comparing their classification of the record (which, at the outset, is largely arbitrary) with the known actual classification of the record.  The errors from the initial classification of the first record is fed back into the network, and used to modify the networks algorithm the second time around, and so on for many iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of neural networks is an iterative learning process in which data cases (rows) are presented to the network one at a time, and the weights associated with the input values are adjusted each time.  After all cases are presented, the process often starts over again. During this learning phase, the network learns by adjusting the weights so as to be able to predict the correct class label of input samples. Neural network learning is also referred to as \"connectionist learning,\" due to connections between the units. Advantages of neural networks include their high tolerance to noisy data, as well as their ability to classify patterns on which they have not been trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Question: So how does ANN adjusts weights and Biases to correct its predection?_\n",
    "\n",
    "__Learning rule__: The learning rule is a rule or an algorithm which modifies the parameters of the neural network, in order for a given input to the network to produce a favored output. This learning process typically amounts to modifying the weights and thresholds.\n",

    "2. __Perceptron learning rule__ – Network starts its learning by assigning a random value to each weight.\n",
    "3. __Delta learning rule__ – Modification in sympatric weight of a node is equal to the multiplication of error and the input.\n",
    "4. __Correlation learning rule__ – The correlation rule is the supervised learning.\n",
    "5. __Outstar learning rule__ – We can use it when it assumes that nodes or neurons in a network arranged in a layer.\n"

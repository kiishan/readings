    "   f(z) = 1/(1+e -z )\n",
    "\n",
    "   The values of a logistic function will range from 0 to 1. The values of Z will vary from -infinity to +infinity.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Why is logistic regression very popular?\n",
    "Logistic regression is famous because it can convert the values of logits (logodds), which can range from -infinity to +infinity to a range between 0 and 1. As logistic functions output the probability of occurrence of an event, it can be applied to many real-life scenarios. It is for this reason that the logistic regression model is very popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the formula for the logistic regression function?\n",
    "f(z) = 1/(1+e^-(α+1X1+2X2+….+kXk))\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How can the probability of a logistic regression model be expressed as conditional probability?\n",
    "P(Discrete value of Target variable | X1, X2, X3….Xk).  It is the probability of the target variable to take up a discrete value (either 0 or 1 in case of binary classification problems) when the values of independent variables are given. For example, the probability an employee will attrite (target variable) given his attributes such as his age, salary, KRA’s, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are odds?\n",
    "It is the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring. For example, let’s assume that the probability of winning a lottery is 0.01. Then, the probability of not winning is 1- 0.01 = 0.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds of winning the lottery = (Probability of winning)/(probability of not winning)\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds of winning the lottery = 0.01/0.99\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds of winning the lottery is 1 to 99, and the odds of not winning the lottery is 99 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the outputs of the logistic model and the logistic function?\n",
    "The logistic model outputs the logits, i.e. log odds; and the logistic function outputs the probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Logistic model = α+1X1+2X2+….+kXk. The output of the same will be logits.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Logistic function = f(z) = 1/(1+e-(α+1X1+2X2+….+kXk)). The output, in this case, will be the probabilities.\n",

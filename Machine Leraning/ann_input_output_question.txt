what will be my input shape if i have 4 independent and 1 dependent variable for a regression problem.

what will be the shape of my input layer if my image size [256,256,3].
what input shape is expected by a convolution layer and what will be the  output shape.
what input shape is expected by a max pooling layer and what will be the  output shape.
what input shape is expected by a fully connnected layer and what will be the  output shape.
can we give a variable shape of input image to image classification network.
how to calculate the number of parameters in a neural network.
how backpropagation is performed in conwolution layers.

my mnist digit classifier network has an accuracy of 98%, i add one more hidden layer to it and the accuracy comes down to 23%. what are the probable causes for this behaviour.
why the loss func

what is exploding gradient problem.  how to solve it?

what is softmax? when and where do we use it?
why image classsification and object detection networks use relu activation, what are its disadvantages.
